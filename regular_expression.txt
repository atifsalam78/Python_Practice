[arn] 		- Returns a match where one of the specified characters (a, r, or n) is present
[a-n] 		- Returns a match for any lower case character, alphabetically between a and n
[^arn] 		- Returns a match for any character EXCEPT a, r, and n
[0123]		- Returns a match where any of the specified digits (0, 1, 2, or 3) are present
[0-9]		- Returns a match for any digit between 0 and 9
[0-5][0-9]	- Returns a match for any two-digit numbers from 00 and 59
[a-zA-Z]	- Returns a match for any character alphabetically between a and z, lower case OR upper case
[+]		- In sets, +, *, ., |, (), $,{} has no special meaning, so [+] means: return a match for any + character
